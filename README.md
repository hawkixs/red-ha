# headless-agents

Run headless CLI agents (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, `agy --print`) under a
capability profile the caller supplies.

This package is the shared agent runtime of the ReD ecosystem, hosted as a uv
workspace member of the [brain-v42](https://github.com/hawkixs/brain-v42)
repository and installable on its own:

```sh
uv add "headless-agents @ git+https://github.com/hawkixs/brain-v42.git@<tag>#subdirectory=packages/headless-agents"
```

Its dependencies are `pydantic` and `structlog` -- nothing else. Importing it
pulls no database driver, no MCP server framework and no HTTP server.

## What it does, and what it refuses to decide

The runtime executes; it never decides. Every policy is data the caller hands
in:

- **which provider and which model** -- the caller builds a `RunSpec`;
- **which MCP server, with which bearer and which tool allowlist** -- a
  `CapabilityProfile` carries the server name, URL, bearer, headers and tools,
  or `mcp=None` for a run that may reach no server at all;
- **which credentials** -- relative paths under the caller's real `HOME`,
  symlinked into the ephemeral one by default, copied `0600` on request, never
  copied silently;
- **which tool guard** -- a `PreToolUse` hook script the caller ships and
  points at.

The package knows nothing about the Brain MCP server, about the nightly
Dream's phases, or about any project. It must never import `brain_v42`; a
test guards that boundary.

## Licence

Apache-2.0, same as the repository that hosts it.
