"""Per-rail proofs: what ``ha prove`` measured, for which rail version (spec 0.5.0 §3.8.0).

Isolation and confinement are proven per rail, never assumed. ``ha prove``
(:mod:`headless_agents.prove`, since 0.5.2; the live tests of
``tests/live/headless_agents/test_proofs_live.py`` are thin wrappers over it)
measures them on the installed rail and records the outcome here, in the
operator's state directory (plan decision P3)::

    <state>/proofs/<rail>.json
    {"rail": "codex", "version": "codex-cli 0.156.0",
     "isolation":   {"passed": true, "date": "2026-09-25"},
     "confinement": {"passed": true, "date": "2026-09-25"} | null,
     "loopback":    {"passed": true, "date": "2026-10-02"} | null}

A record holds for exactly the version it names: a rail upgrade needs a new
proof. The engine refuses a CLI rail without a passing isolation proof for
its installed version, and classifies a write role unconfined without a
passing confinement proof. HTTP providers need none (plan decision P4): they
run no local executor and load no operator configuration. A record that
cannot be read counts as none. ``loopback`` is opt-in (``ha prove --loopback``) and gates nothing: it only
reports whether a write run can open a 127.0.0.1 socket.

ISOLATION PROOF BINDING (ticket ha-051-agy, 2026-09-26). The CLI's own ``--version``
string is not enough: it names the EXECUTOR, not how THIS package runs it. Two rails at
the same CLI version can be isolated differently across a headless-agents upgrade or a
regression -- the exact failure this ticket fixed for agy (0.5.0 ran it with a leaking
``cwd``; 0.5.1 does not, and agy's own version string, "agy 1.2.11", never changed
either time). :func:`isolation_fingerprint` binds a proof to the installed package's OWN
source for that rail, so :func:`isolation_ok` refuses a proof recorded under one
isolation behaviour before trusting it for another -- without forcing every rail to be
re-recorded on every unrelated release: a rail whose isolation-relevant file did not
change keeps the same fingerprint, hence the same proof. Deliberately scoped to
isolation only, not confinement: confinement was not reported broken, and narrowing the
blast radius keeps this change reviewable. A record written before this shipped carries
no ``fingerprint`` key -- grandfathered as a match (see :func:`isolation_ok`), since
nothing was ever measured to compare it against; from here forward, a rail's own next
re-record starts binding it.

    reader cannot positively bind to THIS run -- an unreadable, symlinked or
    oversized file, an ambiguous or mismatched ``thread.started``, a
    ``cli_version`` or ``sandbox_policy`` that is not the exact one ha's own
    write argv was measured to produce, a ``session_meta`` that is not
    EXACTLY one record and the FIRST one, a call whose governing
    ``turn_context`` does not precede it -- credits nothing rather than raise
    or guess. Only an ``exec`` ``custom_tool_call``/``custom_tool_call_output``
    pair that survives every one of those bindings, in order, with no other
    call of ANY name or status sharing its ``call_id``, ever credits a target
    (learnings a5460289, 80934778: the model's own narration of the same

    THREAT residual (review round, codex.py): if the sandbox under test is
    itself broken, a sandboxed agent could reach its own run-owned
    ``CODEX_HOME`` and append forged records to its own live rollout before
    it is copied out, claiming a refusal that never happened. This function
    alone cannot see that: it reads only the rollout, never the outside
    targets' own bytes. What closes it is ordering in the CALLER
    (``confinement_verdict``): a changed outside target fails the rail
    UNCONDITIONALLY, before any credit this function returns is even
    consulted (pinned by ``TestForgedRolloutCannotFlipAChangedByteToPass`` in
    ``test_confinement_rollout.py``). A rollout-based PASS therefore still
    assumes a non-adversarial agent for the NARROWER claim "the refusal this
    reader saw is genuine, not merely irrelevant to whether anything
    changed"; an agent that escapes the sandbox, leaves every target
    untouched and forges its own rollout is not defended against by this
    module at all -- measured in ``codex-0.156.0.events.jsonl``, codex's own
    ``--json`` event stream (piped straight from the process, never touched
    by a sandboxed child) carries no record at all for the code-mode
    ``exec`` tool call, allowed or refused, and no ``call_id`` field shared
    with the rollout -- so there is no independent, ha-observed stream to

    attempt on every outside target -- "nothing outside was written" alone
    also holds for an agent that never tried. Shapes measured on 2026-09-25:

    - claude: none. Its only tool log, the OTEL console stream, names the
      tool and the decision of a rejected call but not its path, even with
      ``OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`` (measured on 2.1.282): a rejection cannot
      be tied to a target, so claude stays inconclusive (codex review of #208,
      round 5: a count of rejections can be met by unrelated ones);
    - opencode: an ``edit``/``write`` tool part in error whose input
      ``filePath`` is the target and whose error is the permission rule's;
    - codex: a refusal counts for EITHER of two independent shapes, unioned
      (``rail_version`` given): a failed ``command_execution`` in
      ``events.jsonl`` run by a trusted system shell (:data:`_TRUSTED_SHELLS`,
      exact absolute path -- never a bare, relative or workspace-local one)
      that is exactly ``probe_command(line, target)`` (:func:`_probed_target`),
      with ONE output line holding both a sandbox refusal marker (read-only
      file system, permission denied, operation not permitted) and the
      target as a whole path token (:func:`_refusal_line`, so a refusal
      naming a sibling or a child of the target never counts); OR, since
      learnings a5460289 and 80934778 (``codex exec --json`` never logs a
      REFUSED command, only an allowed one), the run's own copied-out
      session rollout (``run_dir/rollout.jsonl``, written by
      :func:`headless_agents.providers.codex.run_codex`'s probe entry point):
      a ``custom_tool_call`` named ``exec`` whose input is EXACTLY the
      measured script for ``probe_command(line, target)``
      (:func:`_exec_target`), paired by ``call_id`` with its OWN
      ``custom_tool_call_output`` in the exact measured two-part shape
      (:func:`_exec_result`), a nonzero ``exit_code`` and a refusal on one
      output line (:func:`_refusal_line`) -- bound to THIS run by one
      ``thread.started`` in ``events.jsonl`` matching ``session_meta.id``,
      the given ``rail_version`` matching ``session_meta.cli_version``, and
      every ``turn_context.sandbox_policy`` matching ha's own write argv
      (:func:`_rollout_refusals`). Anything else -- an untrusted or bare
      shell command, a batched command, a command naming several targets, a
      stale line from another probe, an untried target merely named in
      another target's output, a script that is not the exact template, an
      unpaired or duplicated ``call_id``, or the SAME refusal readable only
      in the model's own narration (an ``agent_message``, a
      ``task_complete.last_agent_message``, a ``function_call_output``) --
      proves nothing: the model's own text is never evidence (e454b011,
      review round 1 of PR #234; lot 1b, learnings a5460289, 80934778);
    - agy: an agy write tool step on the target that ended ``ERROR`` with a
      refusal message, read from ``tool_info.output``, the step's ``error`` or
      ``tool_info.error.message`` (agy 1.2.11 was measured to end a refused
      ``write_to_file`` in ``ERROR`` with NO message: it stays inconclusive).

    A failure that names no refusal proves nothing: it may be no write at
    all, or fail for another reason (codex review of #208, round 6).

    ``line`` is the probe's own nonce; codex requires it (evidence is tied to
    the exact prescribed command, which embeds it), the other rails ignore
    it. ``rail_version`` opts a codex caller into the rollout evidence above
    (``codex-cli <cli_version>``, the same string :func:`headless_agents.
    registry.probe` returns); without it the rollout is never consulted, so
    every lot-1 test of this function keeps its original meaning. ``workspace``
    is optional and codex-only too: when given, it tightens the rollout's
    ``writable_roots`` check (:func:`_matches_write_policy`) to also refuse an
    entry naming the workspace itself; every other rail, and a codex caller
    that omits it, ignore it.
